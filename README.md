#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  When writing code for this class I made sure that it was functional by following the rubric.  The rubric acted as a guideline for what the "customer" or "end user" needed.  I also made sure to test every few lines of code.  By doing this I was able to ensure that my code worked and I could move on to the next few lines of code.  I am learning how to make code secure in my next class.  However, I think by following standard coding practices my code should be pretty secure to start with.

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  When thinking about the user needs I looked at the rubric to determine what the "customer" or "end user" needed to code to achieve.  From there It was important to write each requirement or test one at a time.  I tried to write all my tests at once my first try and had major issues as I messed up the first test.  I went back and just did the first until I got it to work.  From there I was able to use that as a good template for the rest of my tests. 

#How do I approach designing software?
  When designing software in school so far I have made sure to lean on the material to help guide me on how to code as well as what to code.  This means that I looked at material for syntax structure. I want to make sure that I write clean secure code.  I also make sure that I follow the rubric as I think this would be similar to what scrum meatings are like as far as what the objective for a class or step in the project is.
